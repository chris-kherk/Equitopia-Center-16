                    It's generally known that horses with a history of <a href="https://www.equitopiacenter.com/">prematurity or dysmaturity</a> may be smaller as adults, but what’s really interesting is that conformationally they may also be different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This applies to the ratios of long bone length: physically, as well as being shorter, these horses tend to have restricted distal limb growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As described in another published study, an unaffected foal looks leggy and tall, with an upright rectangle conformation, while affected foals are less leggy and have more of a square conformation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may not look very wrong in the foal, but as adults, these horses look rather short and their conformation is horizontally rectangular – their head and body are full size, but their limbs somewhat diminutive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When looking at such a horse, hold up a hand to visually block out the distal limb below the knees and hocks, and it’s often possible to see this discrepancy. I do wonder what effect this has on athleticism in the grown horse.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        It's well established in veterinary science that angular limb deformities are associated with poor gestational development, particularly carpal valgus (‘knock knees’).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once again, popular awareness is skewed. The visually obvious issues in the forelimbs may be identified, but the same does not apply to the hind limbs. This comes back to low awareness of ossification stages (commencement is known as osteogenesis).

            <section>
                <p>
                    During gestation, the distal tarsal bones are the last to start developing, with studies having reported the start of ossification of the central and third tarsal to start <i>after</i> day 300. In the gestationally immature foal, the tarsals may be far <i>less ossified</i> than carpals, and are prone to wedging or collapse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have samples of tarsal bones from adult horses that display fracturing over the articular surfaces as a result of neonatal and juvenile loading stress. In foals, the forelimb issues are visually more obvious due to the direction of the mis-angulation and the fact that greater loading causes faster progression, yet hocks should always be rigorously checked for tarsal valgus.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 25px;">
                    Observing horses over the course of my PhD and in the years since, it’s clear that bone remodeling occurs on top of this existing issue. This is especially true in the heavier breeds where rapid weight gain occurs in the first year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A flattening of these bones in heavier individuals may also be associated with an over-straightened hindlimb at a young age. The result is with hindlimbs that appear at once sickle-hocked and cow-hocked; alternatively, there is a characteristic straightening of the hocks and dropping at the fetlocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My view is that the former is associated with early wedging; the latter is associated with later flattening of the distal tarsal bones, which is not identified as a pathology but which certainly affects the ability to be a ridden horse. Poor bone quality is a possible contributing factor here (more on that later).
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 25px;">
                    There’s another underlying factor that can have endocrinological and physiological repercussions, and that’s maldevelopment of the adrenal gland, which leads to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Forgive me for the over-simplification that follows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The HPA axis describes the interaction between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands, which ensures an appropriate response to sensed stress with physiological reactions and subsequent recovery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the equine fetus, the adrenal gland almost doubles in mass after 300 days, as its functions are not required in utero. In a challenged foal, the adrenal cortex may not be fully developed at birth, and adrenocortical dysregulation follows: the ratios and timings of release of stress hormones are severely unsynchronised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anecdotally, a frequent comment from breeder-owners was that these horses are different to train. Heightened reactivity was also reported amongst the ‘hot’ breed cases compared with part-siblings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’d suggest that there’s a further linked endocrinological effect of the poorly developed adrenal gland: aldosterone production may be affected, with a potential impact on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) which regulates blood volume, electrolyte balance, and systemic vascular resistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My concern here is the effect on electrolyte balance, particularly of calcium, with consequences for bone quality (osteopenia) and reactive behaviour alike. If this sounds like a stretch, consider that around 50% of humans born prematurity experience early onset arthritis.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        In a published study, I found that our immature cases had either a lower or higher salivary cortisol response after a stressful event. Again, this bilateral deviation mirrors scientifically evidenced findings in humans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The result is that the horse may remain stressed for longer, which I believe has implications for future health, learning, training, and quality of life. More research is needed, as we always say.

                    It's clear to me that persistent effects of gestational immaturity, especially when linked with neonatal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stressor">stressors</a>, are deserving of further investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At present, I recommend that owners of potentially affected foals talk to their veterinarians about radiographing hocks as well as knee, not just at the neonatal stage but at one year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Basic photographic records are also helpful for monitoring joint angles, and developmental progress or lack thereof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If extra calcium can be administered, along with required minerals, so much the better for bone health and strength – this may be via the mare’s nutrition prior to weaning, or via preparation of the mare’s feed prior to creep feeding.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 25px;">
                    Heavier breed horses should be carefully managed for optimal weight gain, as rapid development can severely affect tarsal bones at ages from 8 months onwards, as the weight gain dramatically increases loading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nutrition supplemented for bone strength and health would definitely aid in preventing tarsal collapse or flattening – I am also of the firm belief that many horses require more calcium, as these are the outliers to the normal recommended ranges for daily intake. My anecdotal experience has been a reduction in nervous behavior in case horses when this is implemented.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 25px;">
                    In my view, it’s not a case of whether horses have problems connected to gestational immaturity, but why on earth wouldn’t they?
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are silent problems that are only recognized when they rear their proverbial ugly heads further down the line, probably only once further more regular issues are added to the horse’s health mix – if they are recognized at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may take a new stressor to reveal the presence of an abnormal response to stress. Meanwhile, the fact is that for many of these horses and ponies, life is not easy and in a time of growing concern over social licence to ride, we really need to be thinking a lot more deeply about this.
